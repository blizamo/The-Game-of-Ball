#The Game of Ball - Rules v1.0

The idea behind the game of ball is that it is a game where the rules are constantly shifting, and a little bit chaotic. The object of the game is to score the most points.

To play the game you will need these items:

- Game Board
- 17 Player Cards (large and small)
- A deck of event and scoring cardss (the player cards should be removed from these and the rest shuffles together.
- Stands for the small player cards
- Markers to indicate “The ball”
- At least 1 six sided die
- Something to keep score

##The Board
The board is made up of hexes, it is within these hexes that the players move. At the edge of the board are 6 striped “zones”. Each zone belongs to a player (if there are enough playing) the player choses the same color card stand to match their zone. Some hexes are only half colored by stipes in a zone, these hexes still count as being “in” a zone, some hexes belong to more than one zone.

Around the edge of the board is a dotted white line, everything outside of this is “outside of the play area”. If a hex is divided in half by the white line, it is considered “outside of the play area”, but also still in the designated zone. Players may move “outside of the play area” if the wish.

##The Player Card

In the game of ball a “player” is always refering to the card representation of the player, the word “team” is used to refer to the human player who is in control of his team of players within the game.


##Drafting your players

The game begins by laying out all the player cards on a table, and putting the miniplayer cards on top of each player card. Drafting is done in a round robin fashion, the first team will pick a player card and then the next team will pick a player card and continue until everyone has picked a player. The first team then chooses their second player and this continues until everyone has three players on their team.

The mini player cards are put in their appropraite team color stands and are put in any space to start out with in the team’s zone. The undrafter players are set to the side of the game.

The large player information cards are lined up in front of their respective team owner.

##Determining the starting rules

To determine the starting rules of the game take the top card off of the shuffled deck of cards, if it is a scoring rule or extra rule put it into the dotted rectangle on the game board, if it is an event card discard it and continue drawing until you get a rule card. Keep doing this until you have both a scoring rule (red flag) and extra rule (orange flag) on the board. The discarded cards are shuffled back into the deck. The ball marker is put in the center hex of the board.

##The Anatamoy of a round

1. Draw cards
At the begining of the round each team draws enough cards so that they have 3 cards in their hand. 

2. Play Rule cards
During each round a team may play one card from their hand. At the begining of the round, each team may play a rule card, the team with the highest score plays first (in case of tie it is in the same order that turns are taken). If any one decides to play a rule card it replaces the previous rule card and it is added to the discard pile. If more than one rule card is played in a round, the last rule played is the one that takes effect. The rest are added to the discard pile.

3. Moving Players / Event cards
After the rules are played the teams take turns moving their players. There are three turns to each round and on each turn a team may move or use an action of one of their players. At any time during a round a team may play an event card from their hand, but they may only play one card per round, if they played a rule card they may not play an event card.

Players have 3 “states” : “Active”, “Tired” and “Down”. The large player card is position represents this state. If the player is active the card is right side up, if the player is tired the card is turned onto its side,a 90 degree turn. If the player is down the card is turned upside down. At the begining of each round a player moves “up” one of the states. If they are “Down” they become “Tired” if they are “Tired” they become “Active”. A “Tired” or “Down” player may not take an action during a round. Each player card may make one action per round (if able), after taking an action, a player become “tired”. These actions include:

#Moving.

A player may move the number of hexes equal to or less than their speed. Players may not move through spaces occupied by opposing players.

#Checking.

If a player is next to another player they may attempt to check the player. To do so they roll the number of six side dice equal to their size. The player who is being checked also rolls the number of six sided dice equal to their size. If the player attempting to check rolls a higher total than the defender than the defending player becomes “checked” which means that if they have control of a ball they lose control. If the defending player state was “active” they become “tired” if it was “tired” they become “down”.

#Passing/Shooting.

If the player is in control of a ball they may pass the ball to a team mate. The number of hexes that the ball may move is indicated by their “pass” stat listed on their card. A pass or shot must travel in a straight line of hexes as illustrated in the diagram below. A pass/shot using the players feet may not go through a hex occupied by an opposing player, a pass or shot made with the hands may go through a hex occupied by an opposing player but that player has the opportunity to intercept the ball. They do this by rolling a six sided die, if they roll a 1 that player intercepts and gains control of the ball. (This does not count as an action).

A shot is only made in an attempt to score a point in accordance to a scoring rule card. A shot must be made towards a valid goal, though it does not have to actually reach the goal. If the player making the shot does not have a high enough stat to reach the goal the ball stops in the last hex it reaches, but this hex can not be occupied by a team mate.

The turns are made round robin and after the last player takes their third turn a new round begins.

#Ball Control

If a player ends their move on the same hex as a ball token that player has “control” of the ball, which means they can shoot and pass it and that the ball token moves with the player when the player moves.

If something causes the player to lose control of the ball the team that made the player lose control of the ball puts the ball token into the closest unoccupied hex of their choice.
