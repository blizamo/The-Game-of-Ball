What is The Game of Ball™?

In short it is a sports game, on a board, played by up to six teams.

To explain further, do you remember the game you played as a kid, where you just kind of made up the rules as you went along? You were outside with an odd number of friends with a half inflated basketball and a couple of NERF guns but no basketball hoop. You split up into teams, and decided that anyone who made it to the fence got a point. The game started and the rules just progressed to fit the needs of whoever was making up the rules at the time? "No shooting while reloading!", says the kid who is reloading. "You just have to touch the other person with one hand instead of tackling!", says the little guy who can't bring down anyone.


The Game of Ball is that game. Except it's a board game, so you don't have to go outside or exert yourself physically in any way.
